Stratagies and possible demonstration
1. NO collaboration -> Random
2. Collaboration without pioneer (decentralized) -> More Dispersion factor
3. Collaboration with Pioneer -> FAster exit


Tower Communication
    1. Robots move
    2. Whenever they are near a Tower, they exchange messages
    3. The tower can have infinite memory so can store all messages, while robots only have a limited space 
    (limited visited, limited communicated, unlimited buffer) -> cannot be implemented 
    4. The Pioneer robot Communicates, that exit-found and pioneer to near by towers, so they can tell other robots

    Tower generation from mouse
    No. of message exchanges
    No. of message processed

    battery - steps
              message
    leader - extra drainage  

    Stratagies
    1. Collab-off -> more steps, more message exchanges, more message processed
    2. collab-on + Decentralized -> less-steps with pioneer, communication range not implemented yet
    3. Collab-on + centralized -> not much faster but lesser message exchanges
